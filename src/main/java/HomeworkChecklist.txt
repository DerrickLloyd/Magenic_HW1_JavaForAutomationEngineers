SHORT ANSWERS
    [X] Comment below what the difference between TestNG and the main method is
        // ANSWER HERE: The TestNG has assertion, so if the output is different from the expected result, the test will fail. For the main method, it will pass if the syntax is correct, but we do not have expected result, so it does not display a reliable result.
